[BACKGROUND] to improve the search performance of moea / d , this work focuses on the solution update method in the conventional moea / d and proposes its alternative , the chain - reaction solution update . [BACKGROUND] the proposed method is designed to maintain and improve the variable ( genetic ) diversity in the population by avoiding duplication of solutions in the population . [BACKGROUND] in addition , the proposed method determines the order of existing solutions to be updated depending on the location of each offspring in the objective space . [BACKGROUND] furthermore , when an existing solution in the population is replaced by a new offspring , the proposed method tries to reutilize the existing solution for other search directions by recursively performing the proposed chain - reaction update procedure . [METHODS] this work uses discrete knapsack and continuous wfg4 problems with 2 - 8 objectives . [RESULTS] experimental results using knapsack problems show the proposed chain - reaction update contributes to improving the search performance of moea / d by enhancing the diversity of solutions in the objective space . [RESULTS] in addition , experimental results using wfg4 problems show that the search performance of moea / d can be further improved using the proposed method . [RESULTS] evolutionary algorithms are particularly suited to solve multi - objective optimization problems ( mops ) since they can find a set of non - dominated solutions to approximate the pareto front from the population in a single run @xcite0 @xcite0 ) . [RESULTS] moea / d , one of the representative multi - objective evolutionary algorithms ( moeas ) , decomposes an mop into a number of sub - problems . [RESULTS] in the original moea / d @xcite1 , each sub - problem is a singleobjective optimization problem defined by a scalarizing function using a weight vector . [RESULTS] each scalarizing function is used to search for a search direction in the multi - dimensional objective space . [CONCLUSIONS] the decomposition of the objective space in moea / d is a promising approach for solving manyobjective optimization problems ( maops ) which optimizes four or more objective functions simultaneously , and the latest version of nsga , nsga - iii , designed especially for solving maops also introduced the concept of the decomposition @xcite2 ) . [CONCLUSIONS] this work focuses on moea / d and tries to improve its search performance in multi - and many - objective optimization . [CONCLUSIONS] moea / d assigns one solution with each scalar optimization directed by a weight and simultaneously optimizes them to approximate the pareto front . [CONCLUSIONS] to generate one offspring , moea / d focuses on a weight vector and selects parents from existing solutions assigned to neighbor weights of the focused weight . [CONCLUSIONS] then , moea / d generates an offspring from the selected parents and updates each of the existing solutions with the generated offspring when it achieves better scalarizing function value . [CONCLUSIONS] this work focuses on three problems of the solution update method in the conventional moea / d. [CONCLUSIONS] the first problem is that the deterioration of variable ( genetic ) diversity in the population due to which the conventional moea / d tries to update multiple existing solutions in the population with a single offspring . [CONCLUSIONS] the second problem is that positions of generated offspring in the objective space can not be considered to determine their target solutions to be updated due to that the conventional moea / d predetermines target solutions before each offspring is generated . [CONCLUSIONS] the third problem is that existing solutions replaced with new offspring can not be reutilized in the population even if they are good for other scalarizing functions due to which the conventional moea / d just deletes existing solutions with worse scalarizing function value than offspring . [CONCLUSIONS] to overcome these problems of the solution update method in the conventional moea / d , this work proposes an alternative solution update method . [CONCLUSIONS] for the first problem , the proposed method does not update multiple existing solutions in the population with a single offspring to avoid the duplication of solutions and the deterioration of variable ( genetic ) diversity in the population . [CONCLUSIONS] in the proposed method , only one existing solution can be updated with a single offspring to maintain and improve the variable diversity in the population . [CONCLUSIONS] for the second problem , the proposed method does not determine target solutions to be updated until each offspring is generated and evaluated since the appropriate target solutions are unknown until the location of each offspring in the objective space is known . [CONCLUSIONS] therefore , the proposed method determines the order of target solutions to be updated depending on the location of each offspring in the objective space after each of them are generated and evaluated . [CONCLUSIONS] for the third problem , the proposed method does not simply delete existing solutions even if their scalarizing function values for current weight vectors are worse than new offspring . [CONCLUSIONS] when an existing solution in the population is replaced with a new solution , the proposed method tries to reutilize the existing solution for other weight vectors , that is , scalarizing function values of the existing solution for other weight vectors are checked before it is deleted , and it has the opportunity to update a solution assigned to another weight and remain in the population . [CONCLUSIONS] in this work , the proposed solution update method is called the chain - reaction solution update since pairs of a solution and a weight vector are continuously updated like a chain reaction by recursively performing the proposed solution update procedure . [CONCLUSIONS] effects of the proposed chain - reaction solution update is verified on discrete multi - and many - objective knapsack problems ( mokps ) and continuous wfg4 problems with 2 - 8 objectives . [CONCLUSIONS] in the experiment , we compare the search performances of moea / d using the conventional solution update method , moea / d using the proposed chain - reaction update ( moea / d - cru ) and nsga - iii @xcite2 ) . [CONCLUSIONS] this paper is the extended work of the paper @xcite3 presented at seal2014 conference for the special issue . [CONCLUSIONS] the previous work @xcite3 ) proposed a method to adaptively determine target solutions to be updated based on the location of each generated offspring in the objective space , and its aim was the search performance improvement of the weighted sum scalarizing function - based moea / d. [CONCLUSIONS] on the other hand , the proposed method in this paper involves the concept of the adaptive determination of target solutions to be updated @xcite3 , and additionally introduces the recursive solution update procedure . [CONCLUSIONS] in addition , note that the proposed method in this work is not designed only for improving the search performance of a specific scalarizing function - based moea / d.", "pr_summary": "[CONTENT] [AUTHOR] [BACKGROUND] | [RESULTS] | [RESULTS] | [AUTHOR] [RESULTS] | [BACKGROUND] [CONCLUSIONS] | [BACKGROUND] | [AUTHOR] [CONCLUSIONS] [RESULTS] [SUMMARY] researchers at the university of electro - communications ( uec ) in japan have made improvements to the way in which decision - making algorithms search and present solutions .\nhighly specialized computer algorithms are needed to find the best possible solutions to multi - objective problems ( mops ) in fields such as engineering , economics , and finance .\nthe multi - objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition ( moea / d ) works by decomposing mops into individual sub - problems and selecting an optimal set of possible solutions known as the pareto frontier .\nuec 's hiroyuki sato devised a new method that improves the diversity of solutions presented by moea / d searches .\nsato says the chain reaction solution update avoids duplicated solutions within a search , enhancing the variable diversity in the solution population .\nthe proposed method also determines the order of existing solutions and does not automatically delete solutions if another solution is deemed better .\nsato says initial trials using the updated method showed improvements in its searching ability , but further investigations are required to assess the computational costs .", "plan": "[CONTENT] [AUTHOR] [BACKGROUND] | [RESULTS] | [RESULTS] | [AUTHOR] [RESULTS] | [BACKGROUND] [CONCLUSIONS] | [BACKGROUND] | [AUTHOR] [CONCLUSIONS] [RESULTS] [SUMMARY]"}

[BACKGROUND] however , learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions . [BACKGROUND] to reduce this gap , we propose simulated + unsupervised ( s + u ) learning , where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator 's output using unlabeled real data , while preserving the annotation information from the simulator . [METHODS] we develop a method for s + u learning that uses an adversarial network similar to generative adversarial networks ( gans ) , but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors . [METHODS] we make several key modifications to the standard gan algorithm to preserve annotations , avoid artifacts , and stabilize training : ( i ) a'self - regularization ' term , ( ii ) a local adversarial loss , and ( iii ) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images . [METHODS] we show that this enables generation of highly realistic images , which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study . [METHODS] we quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation . [RESULTS] we show a significant improvement over using synthetic images , and achieve state - of - the - art results on the mpiigaze dataset without any labeled real data .

[CONCLUSIONS] however , labeling such large datasets is expensive and timeconsuming . [CONCLUSIONS] thus , the idea of training on synthetic instead of real images has become appealing because the annotations are automatically available . [CONCLUSIONS] human pose estimation with kinect @xcite6 and , more recently , a plethora of other tasks have been tackled using synthetic data @xcite7 @xcite8 @xcite9 @xcite10 . [CONCLUSIONS] however , learning from synthetic images can be problematic due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions -synthetic data is often not realistic enough , leading the network to learn details only present in synthetic images and failing to generalize well on real images . [CONCLUSIONS] one solution to closing this gap is to improve the simulator . [CONCLUSIONS] however , increasing the realism is often computationally expensive , the content modeling takes a lot of hard work , and even the best rendering algorithms may still fail to model all the characteristics of real images .
